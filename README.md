# TSP_GeneticAlgorithm

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most well know optimization problems.

This problem originally is described as follows: Given a list of cities and the distance between each other, which
is the shortest route to travel across all the cities, such that, you visit all the cities once and you start and
finish in the same city. We now consider the problem with a set of locations inside a city (Berlin52.tsp). 
These locations are represented by two coordinates (x and y).

The distance between two locations is the Euclidean Distance between the two locations.

We apply an optimization algorithm, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for the shortest route.
We  need to visit all the locations once and the starting and end points must be the location number 1.
